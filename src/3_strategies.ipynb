    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we learned two basic types of trading strategies, trending and mean reverting trading strategies. More importantly, we examined the three key elements of designing a successful trading algorithm, namely expected return, expected risk, and capital management. We learned that having trades with positive expectations is a necessary, but not sufficient condition, for long term profitability of trades. We also need to assess the probability of losing capital, and decide how much capital we should allocate to positive expectation traits. We discussed the paramount importance of risk management and position sizing and trading, and reviewed the inadequacies of volatility and beta as measures of risk. And finally, we discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the popular mean variance theory of Markowitz, and the lesser known Kelly Criterion. We also noted that the Kelly Criterion is the optimal capital allocation strategy, but may not be appropriate for everyone."
